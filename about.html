        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>What is this site?</strong> - No, it is not a scamming site.
          This site is more of me exloring both HTML and CSS as I go. The idea
          of this website is a "sneaker shop" displaying its variety of shoes. I
          like me a good pair of shoes, and what better way to show off some
          shoes and my HTML + CSS skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is there to see?</strong> - There isn't much on this site
          as I am only just beginning to learn both HTML and CSS. While clicking
          around you can see the homepage which has icons that when you hover
          over, rise up. I was going to add a showadow affect to them but it
          would have came out looking awkward.
          <u
            >You are also able to click on the pair of shoes "Dunk Low 'Black
            White'"</u
          >
          leading you to another page to display a single shoe in its entirety.
