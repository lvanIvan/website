      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What is this site?</strong> - No, it is not a scamming site.
        This site is more of me exploring both HTML and CSS as I go. The idea of
        this website is a "sneaker shop" displaying its variety of shoes. I like
        me a good pair of shoes, and what better way to show off some shoes and
        my HTML + CSS understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is there to see?</strong> - There isn't much on this site
        as I am only just beginning to learn both HTML and CSS. While clicking
        around you can see the homepage which has icons that when you hover
        over, rise up. I was going to add a showdow effect to them but it would
        have came out looking awkward.
        <u
          >You are also able to click on the pair of shoes "Dunk Low 'Black
          White'" on the sneakers page</u
        >
        leading you to another page to display a single shoe in its entirety.
        The page that is displaying the shoe is <i>currently</i> the only page
        with Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Will the site be updated?</strong> - Product (shoe) wise, no.
        The website will not be updated to actually be able to "sell" shoes, but
        I will continue to update it as I learn more HTML and CSS to make it
        look/intereact wayyy better. As mentioned before, the page displaying
        the pair of shoes contains Java, which I plan on implementing into the
        size and prices below it and into the other pages as well. Another part
        of the site I do plan on updating is the overall color scheme, currently
        white, and display to make it look a bit darker.
      </p>

        <strong>Who made this site?</strong> - Ivan. An aspiring Information
        Security Analyst. Someone who enjoys music, exercising, and now my
        newest hobby, programming.
